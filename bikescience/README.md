## BikeScience modules

The **bikescience** folder contains several modules to analyze bike-sharing trips. These modules have functions that are used in the notebooks.

### Modules

- **[arrow](arrow.py)**: functions to draw the OD flows over maps.
- **[charts](charts.py)**: functions to improve chart visualization.
- **[colab](colab.py)**: functions to build analysis on the Colab environment.
- **[distributions](distributions.py)**: functions to analyze data distribution patterns.
- **[flow](flow.py)**: functions related to the creation of OD flows, such as building OD matrices, merging trips, stations and grid cells, and creating maps wuth bike trip flows.
- **[flow_diffs](flow_diffs.py)**: functions to show differences between bike trip flows.
- **[grid](grid.py)**: functions to create and display grids for the flow analysis.
- **[grid_placements](grid_placements.py)**: variables to adjust the grid area.
- **[hexagon_flows](hexagon_flows.py)**: functions to create and plot OD flows using hexagons.
- **[interface](interface.py)**: functions to create ipywidgets to filter data. 
- **[intersect_ways](intersect_ways.py)**: functions to explore intersection of geometric areas, such as cycling infrastructure, and trip flows.
- **[load_trips](load_trips.py)**: functions to load and filter bike-sharing trip data.
- **[sp_grid](sp_grid.py)**: functions to build a grid area for the city of Sao Paulo.
- **[stations](stations.py)**: functions to create, load and draw data of bike-sharing stations.
- **[tiers](tiers.py)**: functions to split bike trips into tiers.
